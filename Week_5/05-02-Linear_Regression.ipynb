    "## Regression For Non-Random Data\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we worked with random experiment data but, as we know, those are hard to come by. Experiments are very expensive to conduct or simply infeasible. It's very hard to convince McKinsey & Co. to randomly provide their services free of charge so that we can, once and for all, distinguish the value their consulting services brings from the fact that those firms that can afford to pay them are already very well off.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, we shall now delve into non random or observational data. In the following example, we will try to estimate the impact of an additional year of education on hourly wage. As you might have guessed, it is extremely hard to conduct an experiment with education. You can't simply randomize people to 4, 8 or 12 years of education. In this case observational data is all we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's estimate a very simple model. We will regress log hourly wages on years of education. We use logs here so that our parameter estimates have a percentage interpretation (if you never heard about this amazing properties of the log and want to know why that is, check out [this link](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/244199/why-is-it-that-natural-log-changes-are-percentage-changes-what-is-about-logs-th)). With it, we will be able to say that 1 extra year of education yields a wage increase of x%. \n",

This means that this model predicts that wages will increase about 5.3% for every additional year of education. This percentage increase is inline with the belief that education impacts wages in an exponential fashion: we expect that going from 11 to 12 years of education (average to graduate high school) to be less rewarding than going from 14 to 16 years (average to graduate college)."

    "Of course, it is not because we can estimate this simple model that it's correct. Notice how I was carefully with my words saying it **predicts** wage from education. I never said that this prediction was causal. In fact, by now, you probably have very serious reasons to believe this model is biased. Since our data didn't come from a random experiment, we don't know if those that got more education are comparable to those who got less. Going even further, from our understanding of how the world works, we are very certain that they are not comparable. Namely, we can argue that those with more years of education probably have richer parents, and that the increase we are seeing in wages as we increase education is just a reflection of how the family wealth is associated with more years of education. Putting it in math terms, we think that $E[Y_0|T=0] < E[Y_0|T=1]$, that is, those with more education would have higher income anyway, even without so many years of education. If you are really grim about education, you can argue that it can even *reduce* wages by keeping people out of the workforce and lowering their experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, in our data, we have access to lots of other variables. We can see the parents' education `meduc`, `feduc`, the `IQ` score for that person, the number of years of experience `exper` and the tenure of the person in his or her current company `tenure`. We even have some dummy variables for marriage and black ethnicity. "

This will break down arguments such as \"people that have more years of education have it because they have higher IQ. It is not the case that education leads to higher wages. It is just the case that it is correlated with IQ, which is what drives wages\". Well, if we include IQ in our model, then $\\kappa$ becomes the return of an additional year of education while keeping IQ fixed. Pause a little bit to understand what this implies. Even if we can't use randomised controlled trials to keep other factors equal between treated and untreated, regression can do this by including those same factors in the model, even if the data is not random!"

    "Now, back to our question, is the parameter we've estimated for the impact of `educ` on wage causal? I'm sorry to bring it to you, but that will depend on our ability to argue in favor or against that fact that all confounders have been included in the model. Personally, I think they haven't. For instance, we haven't included family wealth. Even if we included family education, that can only be seen as a proxy for wealth. We've also not accounted for factors like personal ambition. It could be that ambition is what causes both more years of education and higher wage, so it is a confounder. This is to show that **causal inference with non-random or observational data should always be taken with a grain of salt**. We can never be sure that all confounders were accounted for.\n",
