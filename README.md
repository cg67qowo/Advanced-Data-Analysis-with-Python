## Course Overview

This course is designed to give you a solid foundational understanding of a broad range of advanced data analysis techniques, emphasizing both conceptual understanding and practical application in Python. <br><br>

The goal is for you to develop a strong baseline in each method, understand its assumptions and uses, and gain hands-on experience applying it to real-world data. In the final project, you are encouraged to **choose one technique that interests you the most** and explore it in depth, building on the foundation established throughout the course.

## Evaluation

Your performance in this course will be evaluated based on the **final assignment (group project)**:

- Project description due by **March 22, 2026**. Describe the dataset you want to use, define 2-3 research questions, and report the planned pipeline.
    - The project description is not part of the final grading, but **mandatory** if you want to submit the assignment.
- Final project: due by **May 4, 2026**. Please hand in:
    - GitHub repository with the code, **thoroughly commented**
    - A report in form of a research paper, between 4 and 8 pages.

### Supplementary Resources
- [*Linear Algebra with Python*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-99-2951-1) by Tsukada et al. — to deepen the basis of linear algebra while preserving an applied approach.
- If you need guidance regarding more basic topics like basic data cleaning and handling, or version control with Git, please refer to the **Basic Python guidelines** I prepared [here](https://github.com/cg67qowo/Introduction-to-Data-Analysis-with-Python/blob/main/Python_Guidelines.pdf).
- In all the slides and notebook, I reference my sources or the sources I used to build my materials. Feel free to use them if you need further guidance, as they are all very good courses!
