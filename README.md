## Course Overview

This course is designed to give you a solid foundational understanding of a broad range of advanced data analysis techniques, emphasizing both conceptual understanding and practical application in Python. <br><br>

The goal is for you to develop a strong baseline in each method, understand its assumptions and uses, and gain hands-on experience applying it to real-world data. In the final project, you are encouraged to **choose one technique that interests you the most** and explore it in depth, building on the foundation established throughout the course.

## üßÆ Evaluation

Your performance in this course will be evaluated based on the **final assignment (group project)**:

- Project description due by **November 3, 2025**. Describe the dataset you want to use, define 2-3 research questions, and report the planned pipeline.
    - The project description is not part of the final grading, but **mandatory** if you want to submit the assignment.
- Final project: due by **December 20, 2025**. Please hand in:
    - GitHub repository with the code, **thoroughly commented**
    - A report in form of a research paper, between 5 and 8 pages.
